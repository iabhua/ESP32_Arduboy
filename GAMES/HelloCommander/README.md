# HelloCommander

"Hello, Commander" is a Turn-Based Strategy game for the Arduboy.

I'm releasing it as-is since tweaking and balancing a TBS is going to take forever.
Since I don't have an Arduboy yet, all coding/testing was done in [ProjectABE](https://community.arduboy.com/t/projectabe-arduboy-emulator-released/4463). [1]

**Main features:**

- Heart-warming, award-winning holiday story with an engaging plot that will change the way you look at life. [2]
- Complex AI that is totally not just Brownian Motion and "shoot whatever's in range". [2]
- Completely original game design. [2]
- Unique soldiers/enemies that level up and earn perks
- Hundreds of complex terrains that influence tactical decisions [3]
- Permadeath. No saves. Doesn't touch EEPROM. *It's a game-design feature!*
- I didn't want to make another game featuring cats, so mine  **has a bunny.**
- Lots of programmer art and no screenshots. Don't want to spoil the profound plot. ;)

[1] EDIT: Got flashlight mode in.
[2] Yeah, not really...
[3] I guess? Give or take. Dunno how far it goes! :sweat_smile:
